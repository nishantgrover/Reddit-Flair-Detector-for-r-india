Hello, I am Pratik Sinha, co-founder of Alt News. I worked as a software engineer for over a decade and a half, and now I am part of the Alt News team that is trying to work on the issue of misinformation/disinformation in India. On Twitter, I can be followed at @free_thinker, and Alt News can be followed at @AltNews.

Please feel free to ask me questions about the issue of misinfo/disinfo, about Alt News, about what the social media platforms are doing, and more."," How does one join your team full-time and part-time? What type of roles do you have? Do you like to eat mangoes? What's your business model? In how many ways do you generate revenue? I suggest everyone listen to the episode ""Fighting Fake News"" in the Seen and Unseen Podcast with Amit Verma. I watched it and learnt a lot about you. I want to Thank you for the brilliant work you are doing. Such work requires a lot of personal sacrifices and I'm sure there are lacs who appreciate it.

I have only one question:

What do you see as AltNews biggest threat today? How can the average Indian help you combat this? Can you guys develop something like a browser extension which can automatically alert about a fake news page when visited. For example, anti virus software indicate weather a web page has malicious links etc. [removed] Do you ever get threat calls by Political parties for exposing fake news? You are doing all your work from Ahmedabad. How do you do verification of information in other cities when someone has to go physically to a place. I'm sure many of us would be ready to volunteer our services in these cases. Do you keep records of who shares the most amount of fake news on Twitter? Would love to see a chart listing the top 25 fake news tweeters in India and share it on Whatsapp in all my groups. I have a feeling that M Kishwar will top the charts if one is prepared Pratik, do you believe in religion/concept of an omnipotent higher power? Hi Pratik,
Been a follower since Alt news inception. Great work, big fan..!
I just wonder why ALT NEWS is not getting much popularity that it deserves. Hire a PR agency may be?
Thanks Have you ever made a mistake? Like not checking a fact or news properly and mislabeling it as false? How did you correct it? Do you think social media platforms should remove content which fact checkers have deemed false? 

If yes, doesn't that put a lot of power in the hands of the factcheckers, who can then easily suppress opinions contrary to theirs? In essence, the question is who checks the factcheckers. 

If no, what can we do to reduce fake news on social media, without taking away people's right to free speech? Yesterday I had a big argument on Twitter(less surprising, eh?) that Altnews shows a bias on one side only, but I countered by saying most of the fake news is generated to favour one side of the table. 

How would Pratik convince people on that side that AltNews is absolutely neutral and brutal when it comes to quashing misinformation/disinformation? I want to contribute to altnews, but live outside India. The funding page  via instamojo only accepts payment methods from India. How else can I donate? How do you guys first determine that one piece of information might be fake?



When determined how do you guys investigate the information further?


Is there one particular thing which is false but its belived to be true by majority which have amused you guys? Can you tell us if during this current government the number of fake news against Muslims has increased in the recent years or not? And if yes How could we tackle it here.

My next question is, Is there a troll army who sends Islamophobic whastapp and twitter messages daily on behalf of BJP to make their front strong?

Edit:And you people are doing a good job for Humanity. Profit or not. The service you are doing with credibility you people have made in recent years is worth praise. Aapka aur Zubair bhai ka Bahot bahot dil se shukriya Dhanyawad. Hi Pratik,   


* Do you think checking whether a news article is fake can be automated in the near future (so that there can be a mobile app that more-or-less does the job)?
* Do you think the prevalence of fake news articles that we are seeing (which is being used by interested parties to shape their narrative) is the new normal in the political scenario from now on? If yes, is there a sustainable way to fight it? Are you hopeful that our current liberal constitution will ultimately prevail over the fascist theocratic ideologies contesting it? In the age of post truth, busting fake informations are still worth it for the people?
I haven't see yet , any politicians or any celebrities apologize or regret for spreading fake news.
How do you defend yourself from allegations that you are more anti bjp? Hi Pratik, I am just curious have you teamed with social media platforms to provide this as a service , also have they incorporated your tool within their platform?",308,1578083328.0,AMA,1067,ejes3k,1578054528.0,"Hi Reddit, I am Pratik Sinha, Co-founder of Alt News, Ask Me Anything",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ejes3k/hi_reddit_i_am_pratik_sinha_cofounder_of_alt_news/
sanand_satwik,"Hi....It's really tough time for everyone. I recently lost my job. My mom is a lever patient. The money which I saved is already spent on my mother's treatment. Now can you tell me how to earn money online? I don't have money actually right now so suggest a way so that I get paid asap. Thanks for reading! üôè

Update: Few of you are asking my qualifications and skills.
An engineering graduate, I have experience in WordPress customization, logo design and content writing. Apart from these, I do have video editing knowledge as well. So please suggest accordingly. Previously I worked in a company which had data annotation work for AI( company lost the project, subsequently I lost my job). Currently, I am learning web technologies like PHP, js."," I'm a freelancer. Don't listen to the idiots here. You can't freelance online as a beginner. That's a hard fact. No one will trust you with a job. I've been freelancing for years and I know what I'm talking about.

Look for NGO's in your area and contact them one by one. Definitely one of them will be able to help. Also look for govt schemes. Call your local municipality or corporation and talk to them. They are waiting to help. You can also start a crowdfunding campaign.

This is a crisis time. It's the correct time to lean on those around you. Look for an opportunity to weather the lockdown and then slowly start looking for a job.

There are no magical ways to make money online if you aren't an expert. Anyone who says otherwise is an idiot or a scammer. Don't listen to them.

Good luck OP and take care. You'll get through this, remind yourself of that often. Maybe you can add your skills to the post and someone could help you. Hey, You can work as a video editor for the Neso Academy channel. He is currently looking for video editors. Upvote for visibility! 

I'm sorry for you and hope you get some suggestions soon. It'd be helpful if you also mention what things you can do or maybe something like your qualifications. Add yourself to Fiverr and DM me your profile/username. I'll see if I can send some video editing work your way. Everyone up vote this post.


Lets help this fellow redditor Mention your skill set. Hey hey! If you are on Facebook, please write a post on Network Capital, I‚Äôm sure many people will come forward and help you. Additional to that, reach out to organisations working locally in your area and like someone said above, try and fill the gap in a disrupted supply chain. I‚Äôm not sure working for NGOs right now would get you any money. It‚Äôs going to be volunteer work only. However you can try and write to Centre For Internet & Society , explaining your situation and see if they can give you any paid work that you can do remotely. All the Best ! Really hope something works out for you. 

P.S you can reach out to this NGO called Milaap , if you need help with some groceries and food. They would be happy to help you, they also run crowdfunding campaigns so if it‚Äôs really hard for you to find employment right now , I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be able to help you in some way. I can probably help with some video editing work. Can't promise anything but let's talk and figure. DMed you. Send me your resume. I'll check if we have relevant openings for you in my company and refer you. [deleted] This is such a messed up fact. The guys who pay taxes don't get any unemployment or old-age benefits when they really need them. Just thrown and neglected like a used refill.

Search for companies who's businesses have boomed like Amazon or something. Some kind of opening should be present.

Apologies if it doesn't works out. I'm not sure..
 But you might wanna try Fiverr , instant money if someone selects you and you do it in the time limit I can sent you some money. PM me your details Uh maybe this is out of your reach financially but I noticed your an engineering student so you might have the know how, or social capital to get this off the ground. I'm looking at creating a distributed manufacturing, power generation, and transportation network in the U.S. The idea is to have people making parts of something. Those parts are transported via drone to another local finishing / assembly plant which is then delivered via drone to the final customer. 

You wouldn't have to build everything at once for this to work. You could for example create a network of local people who have access to or can make 3d printers. Then each of the people who have a printer can then accept jobs from the matter hackers network, and then print them within a certain time frame. The parts could be delivered via traditional mail even. 

I'm really sorry for what's happening to you. I really hope you find something, and probably most of what you find will be easier and more realistic then what I'm proposing. However if we do get a global matter hackers network going it could provide financial stability for so many.

Right now the group I started on Facebook is purely focused on using 3d printers, laser cutters, or just by handiwork i.e. cloth masks to produce PPE for healthcare providers, and our communities in general. You can see what we are doing if you look up COVID Homebrew Mask Relief on Facebook groups. We're actually working on a trully global scale in that group since we have people from all over the world. Ideally each unit would be powered by sustainable/ renewable energy. Each unit would also have food production capacity as well. So if for example someone needs some spinach for example. They could see if it was available on the matter hackers network nearby. 

I personally think humanity deserves a UBI however until that's politically possible I want to utilize networks so that we can all create a web of support for each other. The network could use a certain percent of income to purchase the needed equipment to expand the network so for example eventually you wouldn't need to buy a 3d printer or other equipment it would be provided for you. You would also have to make people use proper ventilation and sequestration techniques while they are printing. The last thing I would want to see is people getting cancer for example due to the fumes.

Again best of luck and thanks for reading this wall of text. Can we start a crowdfund to fund you for once? I mean, OP clearly doesn't have miscellaneous intentions because dude asked how to get fish instead of asking for fish. I'll like to chip in. Fiver is a good place, but it is over crowded [removed] Please post your query on r/jobs and r/programming they will be able to help you out more.

poleco1,," Kiss goodbye to your privacy! Why 9.99%? So our privacy getting sold to foreign company for Rs.43,574 Cr.

Total Jio users : around [37 Cr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio)

Value of one user's privacy : Rs. 1177 /-

Everything who you are for around 15 US dollars. How is it ethical for an ISP to be owned by a data mining company like Facebook? Just fyi; Rs. 43,574 cr = $6.33 billion There is also some sort of agreement between JioMart and WhatsApp involved with this deal. And few days ago there was news regarding Facebook (WhatsApp) and Jio creating an integrated platform like WeChat in China which will encompass everything from groceries to payments and all. Jio and Facebook teaming up to make super app like we chat. Word on the street earlier was both decided to make independently. Now it's a coalition for sure. Friend request accepted. Very wise action from Facebook's point of view. This vertical integration gives them a solid control over a high-potential developing market. They can also leverage India as a launch pad to capture other SEA nations. From the consumer's point of view, this development is a strong threat to their privacy. The government should have implemented stronger data protection laws before allowing such mergers to take place. One demon buys stake in another demon's workshop! Hope net neutrality prevails People talking about how this is bad should remember that Jio is worse than FB on the privacy front. Facebook perspective :

While you assume Govt would already be in their pocket, Zuckerberg goes on to hire Richest man in Asia as his PR face, his go-to man for India... Obviously it is going to cost a lot of money.. But is it totally worth to have Mukesh Bhai on your side.

Mark Zuckerberg is clear about his vision for Facebook. For him Facebook is Internet. For him, FB is like Polio. ‡§è‡§ï ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ ‡§õ‡•Ç‡§ü ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è, ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ü‡•Ç‡§ü ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§è. After deal with Jio, his is looking to penetrate further into Indian market. And that is bound to happen.

AND, content. Digital space.

Entertainment
News
Games

FB has kind of tired hands in all 3 without massive success they expect. Jio is trying hand in all 3 right now. Let's see how it works jointly.

With so much influence in Indian digital space, tough for others to survive.

And yes. WhatsApp payment. That's a done deal now, I assume.

Paytm is getting slaughtered from all sides right now. Gpay eating up UPI market. Phonepe is there (yes,just there,still trying to be SuperApp)..And now WhatsApp UPI. Ooh, Softbank

FB vs Google.. With Google in lead. To all those blaming and getting scared of their privacy because now Jio will sell you out, you realize every app on your phone like dating apps. gaming apps, social media apps, those image uploader apps and what not already have access to your privacy and that ""your privacy"" is already on the market to be sold. 

How do you think these unwanted call centers have your details. 
We all just click the ""I accept"" button without reading the entire terms and conditions. That I accept button is I accept giving my access to my privacy to the App. Aao, milke beche logo ki zindagi, aap mai aur faijbuk Data mining at its best begins now. Opt out from JIO even if it gives you the best offer. Slowly all indian companies will be owned by Americans Laughing on all of you android users- Xprivacy lua user on rooted android. Reliance stock was fun for today's day traders ahh... so thats why they banned china from investing... but didnt write the law saying all FDI is curtailed.

Mukesh bhai has sold the refinery biz to Saudi Aramco and Jio to Facebook .. both monopolies built using regulatory help. Jio's spying will be now even more efficient!

drunk_sithlord,," What do you expect if you allow the market to be open only for a couple of hours? This is a market place where people do not seem to be caring anything about the virus. Lol what's the point of lockdown then? My friend from mizoram was showing me how social distancing is being practiced in NE states. And tbh, people are taking it quite seriously. May be this is the difference between those that are truly literate and those with degrees from various colleges without any actual literacy. So state omplyics on who can have highest number?

vv4life,," [deleted] Guess what. DMK did this model in Chennai for some of the slums. They moved people out of slum settlements into high rise apartments that was built by the government. http://www.tnscb.org/ SRA is a basic version of it ,and living in a SRA complex and low housing is way more congested than living in a slum.

Watch Rajnikanth ' Kaala ' or Dhanush ' Vada chennai ' to understand the crux of the problem Correct me if I am wrong, isn't SRA doing just that? There was a big slum near my area a few years back. A big developer had a massive housing project and a lot of them who were living got accommodation in an sra building. It has running water, electricity and an actual drainage system. Sure there were initial issues, but vertical housing has genuinely been better for all them.

Unlike the bad movies all builders aren't there to steal land. It's been better for all. And if it wasn't for this God knows how many cases would have been here.  Ratan Tata suggested that the people living in slums must be accepted as much a part of the new India as anyone else, rather than being ashamed of their living. He also called coronavirus as a wakeup call to show us the new concerns, such as that arising from living in close proximity Slum people may go back to roads and rent their living spaces. Just saying that it could be possible if no action taken to avoid that. A different POV: Unfortunately capitalism thrives on exploitation. Ratan tata maybe be doing some good, but everything he has gained has also come at a price. Redesigning is barely a solution. In a country like India people are not given housing on the basis of caste, religion, eating habits even though they can afford the place.  Redesign or keep the slums but first our mindset needs change! He said it absolutely right. Man with a vision BA Pass officials themselves don't have any solutions and when people like Ratan Tata give them solutions, they don't want to accept it.

> Ignorance is a knowledge illiteracy. So moving unemployed people to less populated areas with job opportunity suitable to their skill set is wrong?
Ya let them live in major cities and compete with the highly educated people for the same jobs lmao Is it, rich man? Is this mere lip service or are you actually going to do something about this?

sinsandtonic,," Source? Damn! These south Indians always get the good things! /s This inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. 

Unless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don‚Äôt have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. 

When free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. 

Healthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. 

Our tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country‚Äôs rich-poor divide is to reduce. Else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. 

But our political class does not have such a vision. So it‚Äôs all a pipe dream. The even bigger concern when we see only 3~4% of Indians pay taxes. Even though I assume the bottom 50% are tax exempted as their income is very less. The rest 50% should not be tax exempted. Government has always sided with the rich: the reason is two-folded - One, this way the top 10% support the government which in turn causes a huge influence base and Second, once the top 10% support, they are willing to shell some money to the parties as well which is also beneficial for them. Solution would be track every transaction so that black money and bribery can be removed. That way, wealth can be accurately measured. But however, there is doubt if any ruling party would take such a step as this would hugely affect their popularity and funds. [deleted] The more I look at the infographic, more puzzling it becomes. The OP hasn't shown how much% of land mass he is showing with each section. Instead he just labels who will own it, which does not give any info regarding the distribution of wealth. Well King used to own everything before so for Indians this is nothing new ! You have America‚Äôs sympathy. But not our assistance, because our government is about as useful as a paper towel in a tsunami. I earn , let‚Äôs say a very good income by Indian standards and try not to pay any taxes. Please hold on the pitchforks . I don‚Äôt believe that any government will do anything good with my money. There is no trust . 
What I do instead is , funnel that money into A small school that runs for tribal children and provide them quality education. My method maybe imperfect , maybe I can‚Äôt scale beyond 10 kids and maybe I end up spending more than I would have paying my IT . But I am content that my rupees are bringing  real change to the community I live in.  I am too sick and tired to see a government that actually works and have given up entirely . Let‚Äôs change what I can. 20 lakh +pa is 1%.

It's not like 1% are rich Wealth inequality in a developing country is not good. It's the same in every country.

Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_equality I'm from southern part of India. Tamilnadu to be precise. Most people from South India work under some one. Most people from North India work on their own I mean they mostly do business. I saw most of the people like this only. And I see most people from Southern part educated and Northern part uneducated or still under the basic education criteria. Still industries like bollywood where money circulates in crores. We don't have that kinda business or business men here in Southern part. How are you so sure about this? I'm a die hard capitalist. I always see it as 'be more productive and get more' trade.

[Ab main itna bhi kuch khas nahi](https://imgur.com/PN3X7YJ) My dad called me at 10:30 pm and said I love you chua..I was like what??? I was visiting my sister a few months ago. She has a 8-9 yr old daughter. The girl once ran towards the sofa and let a loud fart when she jumped on it. It wasn't a tiny squeal, but a loud proper fart with good bass and heft. Had I not seen her do it I would have thought it came from a 48 year old man. 

I was shocked. For all these years I thought girls didnt fart as shamelessly as we do. I had only read about it and seen some videos but I concluded they were doing it for attention or money. It was an eye opener moment for me..... People who maintain extra marital affairs should give lessons on time management My life ambition is to die peacefully as soon as possible [deleted] **NSFL**: November 2019 mei 2 bike wale hamari eyes k saamne oncoming Scorpio ke front tyres k niche aa gaye, the rider's head got crushed and 4 of us saw it (me and my friends) with our own eyes happening right in front of us. 

We rang ambulance but couldn't gather the courage to look at the gory scene, ambulance came and took them to hospital. 

We were returning from a friend's haldi ceremony and his wedding was on the same night, needless to say the event was completely ruined for us, we couldn't even manage to drive the cars that night. Had to take the drivers because we were that shocked.

Next morning's Newspapers said both guys died. The most horrible thing I saw in my life.

Drive carefully when you are on the road guys, these incidents  stay with you for life. if you need an adrenaline rush go do Bungee. Was going to write down a few things when I realized some of my favorite pens were lying there dried out.

Source: The Wire. JDU opposes the move but walks out. So they are supporting indirectly. Aight!

I got it.

He used 370(3) which gives Prez the power that '370 can cease to exist' provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause 370(2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification. ConsAss dissolved in 1957 and for transferred to State Assembly which right now doesn't exist as there is President rule so according to him, that power of consent of State Assembly gets transferred to the houses of Parliament where, again, according to him, he needs a simple majority (not 2/3) to clear it. In the past days we've seen how RS resignations happened and bills were bulldozed through with parties like YSRCP & BJD supporting BJP in RS so it'll sail right through.

Edit: ConsAss dissolved in 1957 as pointed out and not 1954. Swapan Das Gupta (BJP) asked a relevant question. Whether this will  need a constitutional amendment?

Amit shah noted this and will reply later looks like. Current number of seats in Rajya Sabha-239(excluding the vacant seats)

&#x200B;

How many votes has the BJP secured till now for repelling article 370

|Party|No of seats |Status |
|:-|:-|:-|
|BJP|78|Supports abolishing of  370|
|AIDMK|11|NDA member |
|SP|11|Declared support for BJP|
|BJD |7|Declared support for BJP |
|Independent and others |6|Will most probably support BJP|
|AAP|3 |Declared support for BJP|
|Shiv Sena|3 |NDA member|
|SAD|3 |NDA member|
|BSP|4|Declared support for BJP|
|Nominated|4|Will most probably support BJP|
|YSR  congress |2|Declared support for BJP|
|RPI(a) congress |1|NDA member |
|AGP|1|NDA member|
|SDF|1|NDA member|
|TDP|2|Declared support for BJP|
|Current Total|137||

To get 2/3 majority in Rajya sabha of 239 members : BJP needs 160 members

If JDU ,who dose  not support the Bill ,walks out of the house , then the lowered strength will be 233.

**The new 2/3 majority mark in house of 233 will be 156.**

Currently , BJP stands at 137* and need 19* more members to support . 

Where can the BJP get these 19* members ?

&#x200B;

|Party|Seats|
|:-|:-|
|RJD|5|
|NPF|1|
|PMK|1|
|LJP|1|
|**Total**|**8**|

BJP still needs 7 members more .

Edit 1: TDP just declared support for BJP.

Edit : NCP has decided to abstain from voting

With NCP 4 members abstaining, new strength of house is 229. 3/3 majority mark is 154 now. BJP has 137 members and needs 17 more votes for 2/3 majority. Opposition is in a hard place here. Already they are divided. Okay, so Ladakh is gonna become a UT without any legislators, so that means the Central government will control them directly, (probably by having a governor) 

Jammu and Kashmir, now will become a UT with a legislature, similar to say Pondicherry or Delhi, where the power of the governor will be more powerful than the elected legislators. Also governor will control the police. (Basically this gives the central govt direct control over J&K, since they choose the governor)  

(One lieutenant governor each for Ladakh and J&K)

370 and 35a scrapping would mean:

Central govt had limited power in the subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications in J&K.
(After scrapping central will have full power in regards to these 3 subjects in J&K)

To implement any  constitutional powers in J&K, center needed the state government's concurrence (Now it will not need it)

J&K had a choice of not applying the indian constitution fully since they have their own constitution (Now that it will be scrapped, they will have to follow the Indian constitution completely.

35a defined permanent residents of the state of J&K  which provides privileges to them. But now that it will be scrapped anyone can buy property in J&K, anyone can obtain a job in the J&K govt and anyone can now join colleges run by J&K govt. 

J&K had these special provision which made it have a special status. Now it will not.

Edit: many in replies have said that J&K will have land provisions similar to HP or Uttarakhand, but no in my OPINION i believe the govt will allow people to buy land in J&K (they seem to want to go the way Israel went in West bank, where Israel is making settlements) 
There are VOX videos ill link below (of israeli settlements), that will explain, what i think the govt wants to do

Kejriwal in support. Can anyone tell what good has this article done to the people of Kashmir in the last 70 or so years? Genuinely curious as to why people are against this leaving aside the heavy handedness involved. The timing is very crucial in an international sense too. China can't say a word because of the current situation in Hongkong. Really happy for Ladakh. Jammu atleast got some attention Ladakh was always ignored i hope now there will be proper development in the region. https://theprint.in/diplomacy/modi-govt-had-told-us-about-plans-to-scrap-article-370-twice-last-week-and-in-february/272652/

TLDR : jaishankar had already informed trump administration of the decision to remove article 370.

The members of P5 (usa, China, France, UK, Russia) were also informed in advance about article 370 removal and the reason why it was going to be removed.

The 15 members of un security Council were also informed in advance. Can anyone ELI5? One immediate consequence of this whole thing is the J&K police now coming under central control. So expect a bunch of transfers and inquiries and possibly more outsiders into the police force to make it more effective.

The unstated rationale being that some of the local police are somewhat sympathetic to the separatists' cause. True or not, no way for a layman to tell. Anyone who owns some land in Kashmir is sitting on gains of at least 50% on his/her land holdings. Satish Chandra Mishra, BSP MP, in Rajya Sabha: Our party gives complete support. We want that the Bill be passed. Our party is not expressing any opposition to Article 370 Bill & the other Bill.

https://mobile.twitter.com/ANI/status/1158265936698363904 BSP supporting this move. Can anyone explain the advantages and disadvantages of revoking article 370? EL5 [deleted] Man! Finally something happened. Holy shit I can't believe this is happening. As a kashmiri who has left the Homeland for a long time and hates going back to it because how cut off and underdeveloped it is due to article 370 blocking progress... this is huge. A point on bifurcation and why it makes lot of sense. J&K is not just Kashmir. It is an amalgamation of four distinct regions - Kashmir, Jammu, Gilgit and Ladakh. Ladakh makes up bulk of the area, with Kashmir forming the least area among the four. 

Ladakh is sparsely populated and has different requirements than a progressive state needs. For J&K to build roads and railroads in Ladakh is not feasible investment for a young state. Making Ladakh a UT is a smart master stroke. It now comes under the central government investment and you will see lot of infrastructure improvements and other improvements here. Surely this is great for Ladakh.",3080,1565014908.0,[R]eddiquette,4671,cm7c17,1564986108.0,"Government proposes to remove Article 370, bifurcate Jammu & Kashmir state [Megathread]",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm7c17/government_proposes_to_remove_article_370/
